# Microtubule Catastrophe Website

## Overview
This website showcases work done throughout Caltech's BE/Bi 103a course utilizing a fantastic dataset from [Garner, Zanic, et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037). Special thanks to Justin Bois and course staff for making all of this possible, as well as to Griffin Chure for instruction on reproducible research and providing the [template](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_website) for this website.

## Reproduce This Work
All code used for modeling and figure generation as well as all necessary datasets are located at our repository [here](https://github.com/vichens/microtubules).
